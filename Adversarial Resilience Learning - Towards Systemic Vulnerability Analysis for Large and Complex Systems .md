Adversarial Resilience Learning - Towards Systemic Vulnerability Analysis for Large and Complex Systems 
Additional Key Words and Phrases:  reinforcement learning ; adversarial control; resilience; power grid

1. Resilience is modelled as a sequential process: Plan, Absorb, Recover and Adaptive
2. dversarial Resilience Learning (informal)).ARL is
  an experimental structure comprised of two disjoint groups of agents
  and a system or simulated system.  The agents are distinguished
  as attacker and defender by adhering to conflicting optimisation
  objectives.  Both groups of agents receive their input from a, po-
  tentially overlapping, set of measurements from the system. They
  inuence the system through two disjunct sets of outputs connected
  to controls in the simulated system
