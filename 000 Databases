video, 
ImageNet VID [26] and YouTube Bounding Boxes [24] (YTBB).
ImageNet VID contains 20 classes and almost four
thousand videos, with every object instance annotated in every frame. YTBB
contains 23 classes and 240k videos from YouTube, with a single instance of each
class annotated once per second for up to twenty seconds. YTBB specifically aims
to comprise videos “in the wild” by considering only those with 100 views or less
on  YouTube.
